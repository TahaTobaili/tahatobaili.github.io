		<h2>Welcome to my homepage!</h2>

		<p>
		I could describe myself as the jack of many trades, master of some.. I enjoy a skill pallete of different disciplines in life: <br/><br/>
		 
		Solving linguistic complexities to develop Natural Language Understanding (NLU) machines has always sparked my interest, specifically in dealing with
		under-resourced languages or multi-lingual contexts. This stems from my interest in languages in general and affective computing, the study
		of teaching machines an AI capability to process and react to human emotion. <br><br>
		
		For that I pursued a PhD in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Knowledge Media Institute</a>,
		the Open University, Milton Keynes campus in UK, and completed it in November 2020. Since then I have been in the relevant industry, mostly as an NLP engineer, learning, 		designing, and building in language technologies. <br/><br/>
		
		In parallel, me and my friend are cooking up a startup on low-heat in London.

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<div class="clear20"></div>
		<span><a href="https://amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/Cambridge" target="_blank">Amazon Alexa</a>, Cambridge </span>
		<p> Amazon is famous for their <a href="https://leaders.com/articles/leadership/amazon-leadership-principles/" target="_blank"> Leadership Principles</a>; living these
		principles is the biggest take from this experience. I am a language engineer in the Alexa ASR (automatic speech recognition) team, our task is to identify 
		customer speech correctly and convert it into text. Not limited to one language but my contributions have been mainly for the new Arabic Saudi Arabia locale.

		<span><a href="https://adarga.ai/" target="_blank">Adarga AI</a>, London </span>
		<p>During my PhD I took on a data science internship at Adarga AI in London. Adarga had platforms that collects and analyse news information from online sources.
		They were interested in collecting and analysing social media data as well, so I developed an ingestion library that retrieves Twitter data based on specific metrics 		such as date, location, and or topics of interest. I then focused on retrieving relevant information from the social network structure such as detecting emerging communities 		and identifying social influencers.

		<p>Also during my PhD I did an internship at IBM Watson Analytics for Social Media in Germany. One of Watson’s main strengths was mining and analysing
		large datasets from the internet in different languages; I was responsible for the Arabic NLP. Unlike other languages, simplifying Arabic text is quite 		sophisticated. As such, I developed a rich morphological processor from scratch that boils down inflected words to their base forms by simplifying the 
		linguistic gender, number, case, and tense.

		<h2>Sentiment Analysis for Low-Resourced Languages on Social Media</h2>
		<span style="font-style: italic">PhD Thesis</span>
		<p>
		In 2016 I crossed the Mediterranean from the Middle East to spend four years in the UK and one
		in Germany researching and analysing the complex multilingual social media text. Lebanon, my home country, is one of the very few in the
		entire region where people constantly switch among English or French as they speak their dialectal Arabic, a dialect that is heavily
		influenced by French and Turkish anyway. Recently, the modern generation started to reflect their natural multilingualism in social text by Latinising
		the dialectal Arabic without the need to switch between different scriptures. This newly-formed language became known as Arabizi.  <br><br>
		
		As it is extremely low-resourced and overlooked in the literature of NLP, Latinised Arabic or Arabizi
		made a perfect case for my PhD study. Let alone being low in NLP resources and code-switched with English and French, it is rich in morphology,
		and distinctively lacks a standard orthography. It is a genuine linguistic mess that defies the fundamental techniques of sentiment analysis, the
		task of classifying subjective text as positive, negative, or neutral. <br><br>
		
		With no availble NLP tools to utilise for Arabizi, I addressed a plethora of challenges the hard way, ingesting, preprocessing, and creating
		various datasets for sentiment analysis. I applied machine learning for language identification, then used word embeddings to populate morphologically
		and orthographically rich sentiment lexicons for unsupervised sentiment classification of social media data. <br><br>

		<h2>More About Me</h2>
		<p>Here is my biased opinion about myself: I am an optimistic being, always looking at the bright side of things. Critical thinker; I do not hold a strong opinion 
		in one place, rather I challenge the ones who do. <br/><br/>
		
		I am extremely driven by brain-stimulating activites such as chess, coding, learning a language, or practicing sports. I learned Spanish, German, and a bit of Turkish,
		however nothing quenches my brain as much as highly technical sports. I used to train and compete in chess and tabletennis, until I found Brasilian jiu jitsu, the
		tactical <a href="https://jiujitsutimes.com/5-ways-jiu-jitsu-really-is-just-like-human-chess/" target="_blank">human form of chess,</a> which swiftly became my number one sport obsession though I swim, cycle, and ski regularly for leisure. <br/><br/>
		
		Science, languages, and sports is where most of my intellect and energy is served. I do not aim to peak in one, but I comfortably mastered and competed in all 
		and I am always expanding them on different fronts. I recently learned horse riding and snowboarding but more importantly I am cofounding a new startup that I 
		am excited to annouce soon! <br/><br/>
